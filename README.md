2020 US President Prediction using Machine Learning

Step 1:
Data Collection


Step 2:
Modelling


Step 3:
Test Train


Step 4:
Prediction



Notes:
* Model is good for number of votes
* Prediction is good for predicting votes for either party
* Problem: Number of votes doesn't represent party winning because of electoral college (538)
